# FSU_Libraries_Intro_To_R
This is an overview repository of an Intro to R curriculum and associated R scripts I've made for my data fellowship

Hello, and welcome to my Intro to R workshop materials that I did within FSU Libraries at my data fellowship!

For context, I collaborated with Semy Redda (sredda@fsu.edu) to create a PowerPoint for learners to follow along with, a series of exercises, as well as co-teaching the material in a live workshop environment.
In addition, I wrote further scripts to answer conceptual questions learners had during workshops.

The overall goal of this material was to allow learners to implement Intro to Applied Statistics concepts within an RStudio environment as a foundation to learning the fundamentals of R.

You can also contact my fellowship supervisor Dr. Nicholas Ruhs at nruhs@fsu.edu if you would like to ask additional questions about this particular project or curricula.

As one last note, I made a cleaned version of the Starbucks Menu Nutritional dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu) that is used in some of these scripts. I have uploaded the cleaned version of that dataset to this repository for convenience.
