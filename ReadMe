Hello, and welcome to my Intro to R workshop materials that I did within FSU Libraries at my data fellowship!

For context, I collaborated with Semhal Redda to create a PowerPoint for learners to follow along with, an overall series of exercises, as well as co-teaching the material in a live workshop environment.
In addition, I also wrote further scripts to answer conceptual questions learners had during workshops.

The overall goal of this material was to allow learners to implement Intro to Applied Statistics concepts within an RStudio environment as a foundation to learning the fundamentals of R.

You can also contact my fellowship supervisor Dr. Nicholas Ruhs at nruhs@fsu.edu if you would like to ask additional questions about this particular project or curricula.

As one last note, the workshop uses a dataset that is a cleaned version of a Starbucks Menu Nutritional dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu)
