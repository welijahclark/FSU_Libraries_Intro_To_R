Hello, and welcome to my Intro to R workshop materials that I did within FSU Libraries at my data fellowship!

For context, I collaborated with Semhal Redda to come up with R exercises and teach the material in a live workshop, and I also wrote further scripts to answer follow-up questions learners had.

You can also contact my fellowship supervisor Dr. Nicholas Ruhs at nruhs@fsu.edu if you would like to ask additional questions.
